# Week 5 Homework: Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## My Work Day Scheduler

```md
I have created a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page, the saved events persist
```
